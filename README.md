# Staff Organizer

A tool for businesspeople to organize their staff easily using their phone

WIP:
- Create a Database for the project (Firebase?)
- Fix and Add 'image' to the Staff Creating/Editing view
- Add more fields to the Staff Model
- Styiling (yeah, yeah, I'll do it. I promise...)
- Improve the Drawer also (Maybe an image?)
- Change 'saving' icon on Staff Creating/Editing depending of the action
- Add validators on each Staff Field

Known bugs:
- Selecting a new Role on Creating Staff triggers the build function, deleting everything.
